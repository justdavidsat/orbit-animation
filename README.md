# orbit-animation

This project demonstrates a simple celestial orbit animation using HTML and CSS. It simulates the Earth and Moon orbiting around the Sun, creating a visually appealing representation of their motion.

## How It Works

The animation is created by defining the structure and styling of the celestial bodies (Sun, Earth, and Moon) in HTML and CSS. Keyframe animations are used to simulate their orbital motion.

The animation details are explained in the [HTML](index.html) and [CSS](styles.css) files.

## Installation

To use this animation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/orbit-animation.git
